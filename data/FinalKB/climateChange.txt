Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels. These activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, leading to global warming.

Over the past century, the planet's average temperature has increased significantly, with the last few decades being the warmest on record. This rise in temperature contributes to melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves.

One of the major contributors to climate change is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is released into the atmosphere through the combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas. Other greenhouse gases include methane (from agriculture and livestock), nitrous oxide (from fertilizers), and fluorinated gases used in industrial processes.

Deforestation is another key factor. Forests absorb CO2, and when they are cut down, not only is this capacity lost, but the carbon stored in trees is also released into the atmosphere.

The impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed. Developing countries, which often contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions, are frequently the most vulnerable to its effects. Climate change affects food security, water availability, and human health. It also poses economic risks and can contribute to forced migration and conflict.

To mitigate climate change, nations around the world have agreed to reduce emissions under international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. Solutions include transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, improving energy efficiency, reforestation, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices.

Adaptation is also necessary, such as building resilient infrastructure, developing early warning systems for extreme weather, and protecting ecosystems. Climate education and public awareness play crucial roles in driving both individual and systemic changes.

In conclusion, climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. While it presents complex problems, it also offers opportunities for innovation, collaboration, and a more sustainable future.
